# PyLocalization 

Using OpenCV, Pupil-Apriltags, and Matplotlib I coded a very simple localization program that estimates a 2d position on an FRC game field using an Apriltag map. 

## How to run

Make sure to install the latest versions of OpenCV, Pupil-Apriltags, Matplotlib, and Numpy. After cloning or downloading the zip file, in constants.py make sure to change the FIELD_IMG path for the picture of the FRC game field. Then simple run main.py

## TO DO

The current computations are very slow and the position updates slowly on the game field. Need to do performance optimization later.
