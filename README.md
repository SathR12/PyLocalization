# PyLocalization 

Using OpenCV, Pupil-Apriltags, Matplotlib I coded a very simple localization program that estimates a 2d position on an FRC game field using an Apriltag map. 

## TO DO

The computations are very slow and the position updates slowly on the game field. Need to do performance optimization later.
